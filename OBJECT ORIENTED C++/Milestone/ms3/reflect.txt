Hello Cornel

I enjoyed doing all these three workshops. I really hard time in ms3, but at the same time i learnt a lot. While degubbing my ms3 i figured that something is wrong with my customer
constructor. I decided to change it in the modules where it was neccessary to do so. It work perfectly fine after changing everything else. 

I also enjoyed re-watching your recorded lectures, I felt this class was much better online than in class just because i got to re-watch the lectures.

Thank you very much for providing great lecture. 
Have great christmas Holiday!!!
Mary Christmas in advance.
